## LeRobot Hackathon October 2024

Last month, I had the incredible opportunity to participate in the LeRobot Hackathon, where robotics enthusiasts and AI developers came together to push the boundaries of what's possible in robotic learning.

## What I Built

During the hackathon, I focused on developing a robotic manipulation system that could learn from demonstration. The project involved:

- Implementing vision-based control systems
- Training models on real robot data
- Integrating with the LeRobot framework

## Key Takeaways

The event was a fantastic learning experience that deepened my understanding of:

- Real-world robotics challenges
- The importance of data quality in robot learning
- Collaborative development in the robotics community

The hackathon reinforced my passion for robotics and opened up new possibilities for future projects. Looking forward to applying these insights in upcoming robotics endeavors!
